# Weather-App
This project is a Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the city name entered by the user. The app is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using CSS media queries. Additionally, it includes animations for weather icons and error messages for better user experience.
